- Using sample data:

## Note

This site can only be run at domain name, not folder link.

On your localhost, setting virtual host. Something like `http://simple-blog.local` is ok.

Cannot use as `http://localhost/simple-blog/...`.

Please remove `public` in your domain also, you can point your domain to `public` folder

or use `.httaccess` (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23837933/how-can-i-remove-public-index-php-in-the-url-generated-laravel)

Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/simple-blog/master/virtualhost).

Well done! Now, you can login to the dashboard by access to your_domain_site/admin.

    Username: botble
    Password: 159357
